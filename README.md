Timeline is journal/diary application that allows users to record, delete and edit existing entries. The data is securely persisted onto a cloud base database.  Timeline was implemented with React Native for component rendering and Firebase as the database.

## Features & Implementation

### Entries

Timeline allows a user to add a new entry, delete and edit an existing entry. To create a new entry, simply click on the new notes/icon button on the top right. The existing entries are displayed on the dashboard page where you can swipe right to delete or click to edit. These core functionality was designed to be intuitive and user friendly.

### Firebase integration

Timeline stores all the entries onto Firebase.  This allows the data to be accessed from anywhere and on any device. Utilizing Firebase allows scalability in terms of expanding into Android and Web development by providing a single centralized database.  

### React Native

Timeline was designed with React Native to provide simple easy to use UI.  Utilized many React Native component's such as NavigatorIOS, TouchableHighLight, ListView, ScrollView, etc to provide a smooth flow throughout the application.

### Future Features

There are many features on the roadmap for Timeline. Some of these features are photo integration from camera roll, adding more font styling and emojis, saving records with time/date/weather/location and search for records on dashboard.
